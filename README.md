# Papertrail user frontend

## About

A responsive React web app built for my friends' new project. This
site is very much still in progress, and it currently using dummy data
from my own Northcoders API. Users will eventually be able to see blog
posts by my friends (submitted via a different, password accessed
frontend), vote on these posts, and submit their own stories for review.
Their project is mostly social media focussed, with an idea to share
feminist literature by posting read books to others.
