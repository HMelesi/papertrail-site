# Papertrail user frontend

## About

A responsive React web app built for my friends' new project. This
site is very much still in progress. Users will eventually be able to see blog posts by my friends.

Frontend: ReactJS, Apollo, HTML, CSS.

Backend: GraphQL & GraphCMS.

Their project is mostly social media focussed, with an idea to share
feminist literature by posting read books to others.
